Conceal e-mail addresses in a string by replacing their domain. Useful for concealing up production data—like MySQL dumps—so you can use it locally without worrying about having real addresses on your system.

```php
use Spatie\EmailConcealer\Concealer;

$concealer = Concealer::create();

$concealer->conceal('info@spatie.be');
// "info@example.com"
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/email-concealer
```

## Usage

To conceal a string, create an `Concealer` instance. and call the `conceal` method.

```php
use Spatie\EmailConcealer\Concealer;

$concealer = Concealer::create();

$concealer->conceal('info@spatie.be');
// "info@example.com"
```

The concealer processes every e-mail address it finds in the string. It will ensure that there aren't any unwanted duplicates if the local-part is the same. 

```php
$concealer->conceal('info@spatie.be,info@foo.com,info@bar.com');
// "info@example.com,info-1@foo.com,info-2@bar.com"
```

Equal e-mail addresses will always conceal to the same concealed address.

```php
$concealer->conceal('info@spatie.be,info@foo.com,info@spatie.be');
// "info@example.com,info-1@example.com,info@example.com"
```

If you want to use a different domain than `example.com`, use the `domain` method to set a new one.

```php
$concealer = Concealer::create()->domain('foo.com');

echo $concealer->conceal('info@spatie.be'); // "info@foo.com"
```
